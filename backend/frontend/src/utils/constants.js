! utils
This is new to mae
My mentor said that this would be a good idea and is good practice
The statuses array below is being used in different components so I created a utility folder with it in

# statuses
statuses is just an array of progress points 
This array will be used wehn creating the table
The loop in the table will output these progress points as options
Instead of copy and pasting options, we will use a loop instead
Easier to maintain and scale up or down
 */
export const STATUSES = ["Not started", "In progress", "Submitted", "Reviewed"];
