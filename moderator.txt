Hi

Just wanted to point out a few things.
#1. 
    - The task is meant to be about projects that I've built
    - In my case, it is, just changed the word 'projects' to 'tasks'

#2 
    - Some of the concepts, build patterns and solutions to issues I had might seem a bit too advanced for myself, since I am still learning/studying 
    - They are a bit advanced. That's because I had some help.

    _ REFERENCES _
    - My mentor helped me. He suggested a few build and design patterns that have been implemented.
    - Some of the error handling is also inspired by him
    - It is, however, only small contributions and this projects is still mine. I take full responsibility for it.
